Her Father was very abusive to her Mother, and her earliest recollections were of terror lest he should kill her Mother.  If she did not find her Mother in the house on returning from school, she was indistress till she had searched her up.  They had a comfortable home so far as means could make it so.  When she was ten years of age they were divorced and the Father in a few weeks married again.  Maggie was engaged to be married; the man had been in the place for months.  He wished the marriage performed in Lafayette and persuaded her Mother to let her go with him.  After a time she consented and provided her daughter with wardrobe and gave her fifty dollars in money.  The arrangement was that they should spend the winter in New Orleans and in the spring settle in Kansas and send for the Mother to live with them.  They arrived in Lafayette and the man left the cars and soon returned saying the train did not stop long enough for the ceremony to be performed, and they would be obliged to go further on.  He brought her to Evansville and took her to the hotel, and after seeing her comfortably provided for, left to see what could be done, telling her to sit up for him.  After a time he returned saying they could not be married in this place, but would be obliged to wait till they reached New Orleans.  She asked “why?”  But he only said “Because they paid” She was now in his power, and partly through force and partly through persuasion he accomplished her ruin.  She said she knew she was in a large hotel, and if she did call for help every one would turn against her to charge all the blame upon her, and she would be ruined any way. He remained a few days with her, took her down to Henderson, obtained possession of her money and then left her among strangers.She waited some time for him to return and at length sought a place to work out but got into a poor low down family, who did not pay her her wages.  Her health guiled and her clothes were soon scattered and she desolate.  A chain of circumstances brought her into a fancy home.  While at work she became acquainted with a poor woman who kept house and had several children.  When she was utterly unable to work she went to this woman’s house.  She had great trouble finding food for her family.  One day a girl who was boarding at a fancy house across the street came to the house and asked permission to remain for a few days as an officer was watching to arrest her.  The woman hesitated a while but finally consented.  She began to talk to the woman about taking girls to board saying, “Here you are with hardly enough to eat, when if you would only take this class of boarders you could get along and have plenty,” and the woman consented to do so and several other girls came there, and so without any agency on her part Maggie found herself in a fancy home.  By and by a man came to the house who took great fancy to her and offered to take her away into a private family and board her for himself and she consented.  He only visited her one week.  And the woman not being able to keep her for nothing was going to take her to the poor house, when some one suggested that she apply for admission at the Home.  She remained several months, became a mother, and was twice brought near to death.  The man who took her from the fancy house hearing she was better, skulked around for a long time to get an opportunity to speak with her, and also sought to send notes.  Fearing he would some day succeed in his evil purpose we concluded to send her to Mrs. Smith’s Home in Indianapolis.  She went with Miss Olmstead the Matron, and the man happened to be on the train, and was determined to obtain her hearing.  Miss O. at length told him if he did not leave there she would have him arrested.  They reached Indianapolis in safety.  Maggie remained a year or more there filling the position of assistant and at length found a very pleasant home with a family in Logansport.  Maggie wrote shortly after reaching Indianapolis that she had found the Savior and said she had been saved from death in two ways, through the Home.  That we had saved her from death in some vile house, and from Eternal death as it was prayer offered in our Home that had brought her to feel her sinfulness and to seek the Savior.  Her mother would never consent to have her daughter return to her again.  She was married again herself shortly after, and lived about a year and a half, and died after a sickness of a few days.  Maggie never saw her again, but visited her grave and feels comforted in the hope of meeting her in heaven.  Amelia Harper, her babe died at the Home when about two weeks old.

When taken to church she seemed filled with something of gratitude saying it was nine years since she was last in the house of God and she praised him for sparing her life and bringing her into his courts again.  She felt a desire to bring some thank offering before Him.  She said “The good people must be glad to see the lost sheep come back again.”  She obtained employment in a good family and gave great satisfaction.  She paid for the burial of her child.

Her parents resided in Mass. and occasionally wrote to her.  She has led a bad life for about 12 or 14 years, and appeared to be deep in intrigue and all kind of wickedness.  Still was kind and pleasant in her deportment.  Had acquired many of the low degrading practices of that class.  On the whole she did not give more then ordinary trouble.  She was much affected by the terrible death of Mollie Brown, one of the inmates of the family, and felt it had been blest to her. Her own account of the matter is as follows: “I felt I was a great sinner and I saw how Mollie died—I prayed to the Lord for pardon when I arose in the morning, but after coming down I was not satisfied and something seemed to say to me “Go and pray again.”  I returned to my room and knelt by my bed and asked God to forgive me, and it seemed to me that Jesus came right to me, and I felt he had answered my prayer.”  She seemed steadfast in her way and the other girls felt that she was sincere and had indeed passed from death into life.  She wrote a most touching account of her experience to her aged parents, and it seemed that she was among the number saved out of the depths.   She was anxious to return home at once and arrangements were made to that effect.  It was thought it would be better for her to return with a letter at a member of some church, then for her to return and at once seek some church relation.  We regretted the necessity of such haste in this step but it seemed best under the circumstances.  She therefore presented herself before the cession of the Pres. church and was accepted and publicly received.  She said that anxious as she was to return home she would rather remain here and labor for her own class of whom she had acquaintances with a very large number all along the river cities and towns.  She said she could understand their trials and difficulties much better than any one not experienced in that life.  Friends were rejoiced at this state of mind and hoped she might become a useful worker for Christ.  During the week following her public profession she requested to go out to attend to a little business.  She did not return till late and there showed evidence of liquor.  With great anxiety we watched and cautioned and reproved.  The next Sabbath she went to church with an attendant and on starting for home, stopped suddenly saying I am never going to the Home again and without explanation walked away.  The next day she returned to the Home after a night of intoxication.  She was greatly mortified at her fall but protested that God had blest her, and she hoped he would again.  Her conduct was very uncertain even after this occurrence, and at length she deliberately left the Home and returned to her former life.  It was doubtless her thirst for drink that she led her in this fearful course.This event was a great trial to those laboring in this work, but less trouble resulted from it then we could have expected.
